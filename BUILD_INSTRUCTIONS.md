**Solution:** 
- Ensure ReceiptLock.xcdatamodeld is included in the target
- Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
- Rebuild project

### 2. Permission Issues
**Issue:** App crashes when accessing photos
**Solution:**
- Check Info.plist has proper usage descriptions
- Ensure permissions are requested at runtime

### 3. OCR Not Working
**Issue:** Vision framework errors
**Solution:**
- Ensure device/simulator supports Vision
- Check image format compatibility
- Verify Vision framework is linked
- Check image quality and preprocessing
- Verify OCR text extraction patterns

### 4. Camera Permission Issues
**Issue:** Camera access denied
**Solution:**
- Check Info.plist has camera usage description
- Request permissions at runtime
- Guide user to Settings if denied
- Test on physical device (simulator limitations)

### 5. Notifications Not Appearing
**Issue:** Local notifications not showing
**Solution:**
- Check notification permissions
- Verify notification scheduling logic
- Test on physical device (simulator limitations)

## OCR Processing Workflow

### Text Extraction Process
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Enhance contrast, sharpen text, optimize for OCR
2. **Vision Framework**: Use VNRecognizeTextRequest for high-accuracy text recognition
3. **Language Support**: English language correction and recognition

- **Auto-fill Logic**: Smart field population with user confirmation
- **Fallback Handling**: Manual entry when OCR extraction fails

## File Storage

Receipt files are stored in:
```
Documents/receipts/
â”œâ”€â”€ receipt-uuid-1.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ receipt-uuid-2.pdf
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Permissions Required

The app requests these permissions:
- **Notifications**: For warranty expiry reminders
- **Photo Library**: For selecting receipt images
- **Camera**: For capturing receipt images (optional)

## Error Handling

The app includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Core Data operations
- File I/O operations
- OCR processing
- Notification scheduling
- User input validation

All errors are logged and user-friendly messages are displayed.

## Image Editing & Enhancement

### Built-in Image Editor

- **Receipt Optimization**: Pre-configured settings for better OCR results
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant feedback on image adjustments
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintain image quality for optimal text recognition
- **Batch Processing**: Apply enhancements to multiple images

### Image Storage Optimization
- **Compression**: JPEG compression with quality control (0.8)
- **Resizing**: Automatic resizing for large images (max 2048px)
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Fast loading of receipt lists
- **Storage Monitoring**: Track disk usage and cleanup orphaned files

## Performance Considerations

- Images are compressed before storage
- OCR processing is asynchronous
- Core Data operations are performed on background queues
- File operations include proper error handling
- Memory management for large images
- Camera capture optimization for receipt scanning

## Security

- All data is stored locally
- No network requests
- File access is sandboxed
- No sensitive data logging

## Next Steps

To extend the app, consider:
1. Adding iCloud sync
2. Implementing advanced OCR
3. Adding receipt categorization
4. Creating widgets
5. Adding Apple Watch support
6. Implementing cloud backup
